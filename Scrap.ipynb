      "AI agents. Agentic AI. Agentic architectures. Agentic workflows. Agentic patterns. Agents are everywhere. But what exactly\n",
      "are\n",
      "they, and how do we build robust and effective agentic systems? While the term \"agent\" is used broadly, a key characteristic is their ability to dynamically plan and execute tasks, often leveraging external tools and memory to achieve complex goals.\n",
      "This post aims to explore common design patterns. Think of these patterns as blueprints or reusable templates for building AI applications. Understanding them provides a mental model for tackling complex problems and designing systems that are scalable, modular, and adaptable.\n",
      "We'll dive into several common patterns, differentiating between more structured\n",
      "workflows\n",
      "and more dynamic\n",
      "agentic patterns\n",
      ". Workflows typically follow predefined paths, while agents have more autonomy in deciding their course of action.\n",
      "Why Do (Agentic) Patterns Matter?\n",
      "Patterns provide a structured way to think and design systems.\n",
      "Patterns allow us to build and grow AI applications in complexity and adapt to changing requirements. Modular designs based on patterns are easier to modify and extend.\n",
      "Patterns help manage the complexity of coordinating multiple agents, tools, and workflows by offering proven, reusable templates. They promote best practices and shared understanding among developers.\n",
      "When (and When Not) to Use Agents?\n",
      "Before diving into patterns, it's crucial to consider\n",
      "when\n",
      "an agentic approach is truly necessary.\n",
      "Always seek the simplest solution first. If you know the exact steps required to solve a problem, a fixed workflow or even a simple script might be more efficient and reliable than a agent.\n",
      "Agentic systems often trade increased latency and computational cost for potentially better performance on complex, ambiguous, or dynamic tasks. Be sure the benefits outweigh these costs.\n",
      "Use\n",
      "workflows\n",
      "for predictability and consistency when dealing with well-defined tasks where the steps are known.\n",
      "Use\n",
      "agents\n",
      "when flexibility, adaptability, and model-driven decision-making are needed.\n",
      "Keep it Simple (Still): Even when building agentic systems, strive for the simplest effective design. Overly complex agent can become difficult to debug and manage.\n",
      "Agency introduces inherent unpredictability and potential errors. Agentic systems must incorporate robust error logging, exception handling, and retry mechanisms, allowing the system (or the underlying LLM) a chance to self-correct.\n",
      "Below, we'll explore 3 common workflow patterns and 4 agentic patterns. We'll illustrate each using pure API calls, without relying on specific frameworks like LangChain, LangGraph, LlamaIndex, or CrewAI, to focus on the core concepts.\n",
      "Pattern Overview\n",
      "We will cover the following patterns:\n",

      "Planning Pattern (Orchestrator-Workers)\n",
      "Multi-Agent Pattern\n",
      "Workflow: Prompt Chaining\n",
      "The output of one LLM call sequentially feeds into the input of the next LLM call. This pattern decomposes a task into a fixed sequence of steps. Each step is handled by an LLM call that processes the output from the preceding one. It's suitable for tasks that can be cleanly broken down into predictable, sequential subtasks.\n",
      "Use Cases:\n",
      "Generating a structured document: LLM 1 creates an outline, LLM 2 validates the outline against criteria, LLM 3 writes the content based on the validated outline.\n",

      "An initial LLM acts as a router, classifying the user's input and directing it to the most appropriate specialized task or LLM. This pattern implements a separation of concerns and allows for optimizing individual downstream tasks (using specialized prompts, different models, or specific tools) in isolation. It improves efficiency and potentially reduces costs by using smaller models for simpler tasks. When a task is routed, the selected agent \"takes over\" responsibility for completion.\n",

      "Customer support systems: Routing queries to agents specialized in billing, technical support, or product information.\n",
      "Tiered LLM usage: Routing simple queries to faster, cheaper models (like Llama 3.1 8B) and complex or unusual questions to more capable models (like Gemini 1.5 Pro).\n",

      "Reflection Pattern\n",
      "An agent evaluates its own output and uses that feedback to refine its response iteratively. This pattern is also known as Evaluator-Optimizer and uses a self-correction loop. An initial LLM generates a response or completes a task. A second LLM step (or even the same LLM with a different prompt) then acts as a reflector or evaluator, critiquing the initial output against the requirements or desired quality. This critique (feedback) is then fed back, prompting the LLM to produce a refined output. This cycle can repeat until the evaluator confirms the requirements are met or a satisfing output is achieved.\n",
      "Use Cases:\n",
      "Code generation: Writing code, executing it, using error messages or test results as feedback to fix bugs.\n",
      "Writing and refinement: Generating a draft, reflecting on its clarity and tone, and then revising it.\n",
      "Complex problem solving: Generating a plan, evaluating its feasibility, and refining it based on the evaluation.\n",

      "LLM has the ability to invoke external functions or APIs to interact with the outside world, retrieve information, or perform actions. This pattern often referred to as Function Calling and is the most widely recognized pattern. The LLM is provided with definitions (name, description, input schema) of available tools (functions, APIs, databases, etc.). Based on the user query, the LLM can decide to call one or more tools by generating a structured output (like JSON) matching the required schema. This output is used to execute the actual external tool/function, and the result is returned to the LLM. The LLM then uses this result to formulate its final response to the user. This vastly extends the LLM's capabilities beyond its training data.\n",

This pattern tries to solve complex problems requiring multi-step reasoning by creating an intial Plan. This plan is dynamically generated based on the user input. Subtasks are then assigned to \"Worker\" agents that execute them, potentially in parallel if dependencies allow. An \"Orchestrator\" or \"Synthesizer\" LLM collects the results from the workers, reflects on whether the overall goal has been achieved, and either synthesizes the final output or potentially initiates a re-planning step if necessary. This reduces the cognitive load on any single LLM call, improves reasoning quality, minimizes errors, and allows for dynamic adaptation of the workflow.

      "It's important to remember that these patterns aren't fixed rules but flexible building blocks. Real-world agentic systems often combine elements from multiple patterns. A Planning agent might use Tool Use, and its workers could employ Reflection. A Multi-Agent system might use Routing internally for task assignment.\n",

      "AI agents. Agentic AI. Agentic architectures. Agentic workflows. Agentic patterns. Agents are everywhere. But what exactly\n",
      "are\n",
      "they, and how do we build robust and effective agentic systems? While the term \"agent\" is used broadly, a key characteristic is their ability to dynamically plan and execute tasks, often leveraging external tools and memory to achieve complex goals.\n",
      "This post aims to explore common design patterns. Think of these patterns as blueprints or reusable templates for building AI applications. Understanding them provides a mental model for tackling complex problems and designing systems that are scalable, modular, and adaptable.\n",
      "We'll dive into several common patterns, differentiating between more structured\n",
      "workflows\n",
      "and more dynamic\n",
      "agentic patterns\n",
      ". Workflows typically follow predefined paths, while agents have more autonomy in deciding their course of action.\n",
      "Why Do (Agentic) Patterns Matter?\n",
      "Patterns provide a structured way to think and design systems.\n",
      "Patterns allow us to build and grow AI applications in complexity and adapt to changing requirements. Modular designs based on patterns are easier to modify and extend.\n",
      "Patterns help manage the complexity of coordinating multiple agents, tools, and workflows by offering proven, reusable templates. They promote best practices and shared understanding among developers.\n",
      "When (and When Not) to Use Agents?\n",
      "Before diving into patterns, it's crucial to consider\n",
      "when\n",
      "an agentic approach is truly necessary.\n",
      "Always seek the simplest solution first. If you know the exact steps required to solve a problem, a fixed workflow or even a simple script might be more efficient and reliable than a agent.\n",
      "Agentic systems often trade increased latency and computational cost for potentially better performance on complex, ambiguous, or dynamic tasks. Be sure the benefits outweigh these costs.\n",
      "Use\n",
      "workflows\n",
      "for predictability and consistency when dealing with well-defined tasks where the steps are known.\n",
      "Use\n",
      "agents\n",
      "when flexibility, adaptability, and model-driven decision-making are needed.\n",
      "Keep it Simple (Still): Even when building agentic systems, strive for the simplest effective design. Overly complex agent can become difficult to debug and manage.\n",
      "Agency introduces inherent unpredictability and potential errors. Agentic systems must incorporate robust error logging, exception handling, and retry mechanisms, allowing the system (or the underlying LLM) a chance to self-correct.\n",
      "Below, we'll explore 3 common workflow patterns and 4 agentic patterns. We'll illustrate each using pure API calls, without relying on specific frameworks like LangChain, LangGraph, LlamaIndex, or CrewAI, to focus on the core concepts.\n",
      "Pattern Overview\n",
      "We will cover the following patterns:\n",

      "Planning Pattern (Orchestrator-Workers)\n",
      "Multi-Agent Pattern\n",
      "Workflow: Prompt Chaining\n",
      "The output of one LLM call sequentially feeds into the input of the next LLM call. This pattern decomposes a task into a fixed sequence of steps. Each step is handled by an LLM call that processes the output from the preceding one. It's suitable for tasks that can be cleanly broken down into predictable, sequential subtasks.\n",
      "Use Cases:\n",
      "Generating a structured document: LLM 1 creates an outline, LLM 2 validates the outline against criteria, LLM 3 writes the content based on the validated outline.\n",

Once all branches are complete, their individual results are collected and passed to a final aggregator LLM, which synthesizes them into the final response.

      "An agent evaluates its own output and uses that feedback to refine its response iteratively. This pattern is also known as Evaluator-Optimizer and uses a self-correction loop. An initial LLM generates a response or completes a task. A second LLM step (or even the same LLM with a different prompt) then acts as a reflector or evaluator, critiquing the initial output against the requirements or desired quality. This critique (feedback) is then fed back, prompting the LLM to produce a refined output. This cycle can repeat until the evaluator confirms the requirements are met or a satisfing output is achieved.\n",

      "Code generation: Writing code, executing it, using error messages or test results as feedback to fix bugs.\n",
      "Writing and refinement: Generating a draft, reflecting on its clarity and tone, and then revising it.\n",

      "Tool Use Pattern\n",
      "LLM has the ability to invoke external functions or APIs to interact with the outside world, retrieve information, or perform actions. This pattern often referred to as Function Calling and is the most widely recognized pattern. The LLM is provided with definitions (name, description, input schema) of available tools (functions, APIs, databases, etc.). Based on the user query, the LLM can decide to call one or more tools by generating a structured output (like JSON) matching the required schema. This output is used to execute the actual external tool/function, and the result is returned to the LLM. The LLM then uses this result to formulate its final response to the user. This vastly extends the LLM's capabilities beyond its training data.\n",

      "A central planner LLM breaks down a complex task into a dynamic list of subtasks, which are then delegated to specialized worker agents (often using Tool Use) for execution. This pattern tries to solve complex problems requiring multi-step reasoning by creating an intial Plan. This plan is dynamically generated based on the user input. Subtasks are then assigned to \"Worker\" agents that execute them, potentially in parallel if dependencies allow. An \"Orchestrator\" or \"Synthesizer\" LLM collects the results from the workers, reflects on whether the overall goal has been achieved, and either synthesizes the final output or potentially initiates a re-planning step if necessary. This reduces the cognitive load on any single LLM call, improves reasoning quality, minimizes errors, and allows for dynamic adaptation of the workflow. The key difference from Routing is that the Planner generates a\n",

A Planning agent might use Tool Use, and its workers could employ Reflection. A Multi-Agent system might use Routing internally for task assignment.\n",
